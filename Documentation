1. Colorfu Box

  2. The purpose of my project is to pass and get a good grade in CT, and so I could learn how to code and learn more about coding and technology.

My program works by making an arrow draw a square, with each side having a different color: red, blue, green, and brown. 
To run the program, simply press "Run" in the top left corner and select "Run without Debugging" or use the shortcut Ctrl+F5.
